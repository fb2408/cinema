## Web application to reservation and payment for cinema shows

In this final work I have implemented an application which makes it easier for customers to book and purchase cinema tickets. Thymeleaf was used to implement the front-end application, while the backend was written in Java's IntelliJ development environment while using the Spring Boot framework. PostgreSQL was used as a database management system. The application supports three types of users: unregistered users, users(customers) and administrators. All users are able to inspect movie previews and schedules for each cinema for up to seven days. Users can also book seats, pay for the reservations, collect bonuses, evaluate reservations, etc. System administrator has an ability of arranging all data in the database.
